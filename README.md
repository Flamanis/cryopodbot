# cryopodbot
A bot completely coded in Python 3.5 for helping out the CryopodToHell subreddit!

This bot runs in Python 3.5, and mainly only uses PRAW and Discord.py - you'll have to install those with pip seperately.

It contains all the files, including failed projects (i.e. Project STAT, which was, in a way, brought back recently in the discord update as a discord-only feature.
This means that it contains the Reddit bot, the Discord bot, most of the files they depend on, as well as a few temporary tests that should be ignored.

May I please note, that this is under the GNU General Public License which states that any changes to the code MUST be made available to other users. For this project, it also means that you should not use the bot unless I have explicitly given you permission (along with the reddit credentials and hidden files) to do so. If I do this, you'll know about it as I will announce it in this file and add the trusted user as a contributer - this bot is not to be used/edited or ran without explicit permission from the current main contributer - which, currently, is me.

Finally, if you have any questions about the above, feel free to contact be on the cryopod's discord, which is at https://discord.gg/EkdeJER

Thank you!
